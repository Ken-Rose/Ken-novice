I am Totally new to this type of code or any other and Hope to learn as I go.
my objective is building a new 3D printer  with a BTT control board using 
Kpper and a Raspbery pi connected to my touch screen to provide various access terminals
eg usb,microsd card etc.
it is going to be tuff but although Iam 87 I don't give up easily.
