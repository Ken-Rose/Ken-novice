I am Totally new to this type of code or any other and Hope to learn as I go.
my objective is building a new 3D printer  with a BTT control board using 
Klipper and a Raspberry pi connected to my touch screen to provide various access terminals
e.g. usb, microSD card etc.
it is going to be tuff but although I am 87 I don't give up easily.
